## Wireframe mockups
I initially utilised Balsamiq to produce low fidelity wireframes of how the game would appear across different devices. Although the game was intended to be contained within one page, wireframes were produced for the different content that would appear on the page. Utilising Balsamiq enabled me to consider multiple layouts for the game elements before settling on the final design.

* Insert wireframe images

Once happy with the overall structure for the site, and the layout of each section of the content, I produced a full colour mockup within Figma to test the colour scheme and font selection. The default colour scheme was generated using the Adobe colour selector to pull the colours from the vector image used as the background. For the dark colour scheme, I followed the recommendations provided by material.io which can be found at [material.io](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html)

* insert colour cards

## Features
* Main Menu


* Modals


* Name Entry


* Game Screens


* End Screens


## Future Enhancements

* Leaderboard
  * It would be nice to include a leaderboard so that users can compare their score or results with other players, or with themselves over a period of time. This could increase the challenge for users to try and beat other players or their previous scores.
* Different Levels
  * The game could be extended through the implementation of a level structure which would require the player to work their way through the levels to reach the final Boss.

  * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab
  * Select the pages link from the setting menu on the left hand side 
  * Under the GitHub Pages from the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch 
  * One the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
